* No SSH needed between external etcd and controlplanes 
* ETCDCTL command aliased with all the tls options in the .bashrc. So the controlplane nodes can query it easily

* Add a check at the end of the template script that ensures that the basic commands are installed and warns if they are not 
* Fix 'finding working control plane' sections. They can use the kube-vip address instead 
* Add gVisor runtime along with runtimeclass 
* Add security packages like Falco and Sysdig
